#Lines 4-15 appear to work fine. However, when I paste in lines 18 & 19 to start a For loop, it states "syntax error" for the "<" symbol. Line 18 is the same
#as line 10, so why doesn't line 18 work?

if power <= 1000:
    print('Weak. Need more power.')

else:
    print("That's strong.")

# Line 18 is same as line 10, but it returns "Syntax error."
